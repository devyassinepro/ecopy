                        <h4 class="h6">Step 1: connect <a href="https://ecopy.app" target="_blank">Ecopy</a> with Your Shopify Store</h4>
                        <p>Before you can start importing products, you need to have Ecopy connected on your Shopify store.</p>

                        <iframe width="800" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/noCZIZdcZuY?si=J0UNVRFEav51WNrJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <div>
                        <h4 class="h6">Step 2: Find the <a href="https://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a> Product You Want to Import</h4>
                        <p>Once Ecopy is installed, it’s time to find the product you want to import from Amazon. Open Amazon in your web browser and browse through the categories or use the search bar to locate the item you wish to add to your Shopify store.</p>
                        <div class="table-responsive">
                        <img width="800" height="415" src="assets/img/amazon.png" title="Amazon" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></img>   </div>
                        <div>
                        <h4 class="h6">Step 3: Copy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-45-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B098FKXT8L" target="_blank">Amazon</a> Product URL</h4>
                        <p>When you’ve found the product, copy its URL from the address bar at the top of your browser. This URL contains all the information Ecopy needs to fetch the product details and import them into your Shopify store.</p>
                        <div class="table-responsive">

                        <h4 class="h6">Step 4: Paste the URL into Ecopy</h4>
                        <p>Go back to your Shopify store and open the Ecopy app. You’ll see a simple interface with a field where you can paste the Amazon product URL. Paste the URL into this field and click the "Import" button.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="h6">Step 5: Review and Customize the Product Details</h4>
                        <p>Ecopy will automatically pull the product’s information, including images, descriptions, prices, and more. You’ll have the option to review and customize these details before adding the product to your store. This is a great opportunity to adjust the product title, set your preferred pricing, and ensure the descriptions align with your brand’s voice.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="h6">Step 6: Publish the Product to Your Shopify Store</h4>
                        <p>Once you’re satisfied with the product details, click the "Publish" button. The product will be added to your Shopify store’s inventory, ready for customers to purchase.</p>
