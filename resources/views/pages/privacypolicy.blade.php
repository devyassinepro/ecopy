<ul><li>Browser information</li><li>Server log files</li><li>Statistics concerning messages (including files, video and audio calls and text messages) sent or received through the Services, such as the length of such calls or messages, the IP Addresses involved and other technical parameters</li><li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other technologies</li><li>Demographic information</li><li>Aggregated information</li></ul>

We may also generate a unique device identifier for use by Ecopy to operate the Services.</li><li>Through server log files: Your “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to the device that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user uses the Services, along with the time of the use and the pages or areas visited within the Services. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. We and our third-party service providers use IP Addresses for purposes such as helping to calculate usage levels of the Services diagnose server problems and administer the Services.</li><li>Using cookies: Cookies allow a server to transfer data to a device for record-keeping and other purposes. We and our third-party service providers use cookies and other technologies to, among other things, better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Services, as well as for online tracking purposes. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most devices that allows you to decline the use of cookies.

We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.
